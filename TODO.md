## Open — Infrastructure

- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P0)** — Fused scan kernels for MinGRU, MinLSTM, NativeRecurrence (3 variants), and Liquid (exact solver). Each kernel runs one thread per (batch, hidden) element with state in registers, eliminating per-timestep kernel launch overhead. NIF bridge with GC-tracked cudaMalloc, XLA FFI handlers for EXLA integration. 8 CUDA kernels total. Files: `native/cuda/fused_*.cu`, `c_src/edifice_cuda_nif.c`, `lib/edifice/cuda/{nif,fused_scan}.ex`.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P1)** — Generic `fused_linear_scan` kernel (`h = a*h + b`, no in-kernel nonlinearities) covering 6 architectures: Griffin RG-LRU, MEGA EMA, SSTransformer EMA, HybridBuilder EMA, GSS SSM, MambaVision SSM. All pre-compute `a` and `b` on the XLA side. GSS and MambaVision reshape 3D state `[B,T,D,N]` → `[B,T,D*N]` to reuse the 2D kernel. File: `native/cuda/fused_linear_scan.cu`.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P2)** — Matrix-state recurrences with `[D,D]` state matrices per head. 7 kernels: DeltaNet, GatedDeltaNet, DeltaProduct, sLSTM, TTT, Mamba (selective scan), KDA, RLA (dual-state). All have 3-tier dispatch (custom call → NIF → Elixir). KDA uses per-channel decay; RLA supports both moving-avg and delta-rule variants via mode flag. Files: `native/cuda/fused_{delta_rule,delta_product,slstm,ttt,selective,kda,rla}_scan.cu`.
- [x] **EXLA GPU Custom Call Infrastructure** — GPU-native custom calls staying inside the XLA computation graph (no graph breaks). EXLA fork at `/home/nixos/nx/exla/` with nvcc `.cu` compilation, `-DEXLA_FFI` flag, stablehlo.custom_call bindings in `value.ex`, `cached_recur_operator` CUDA-platform pattern-match in `defn.ex`. Edifice dispatches via `Nx.Shared.optional` with Elixir fallback. All 9 kernels wired: MinGRU, MinLSTM, ELU-GRU, Real-GRU, DiagLinear, Liquid, LinearScan, DeltaNet, GatedDeltaNet. Use `Axon.build(model, compiler: EXLA)` for cached graph compilation (97x speedup).
- [x] **EXLA Custom Calls — All Kernels Wired** — All 9 P0/P1 kernels have `cached_recur_operator` clauses in `defn.ex` and 3-tier dispatch (custom call → NIF → Elixir) in `fused_scan.ex`. 3813 tests pass.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P3)** — Standard LSTM and GRU fused scan kernels. Pre-compute W@x+bias on Axon side, R@h via shared memory in kernel. LSTM: 4-gate (i/f/g/o) with cell+hidden state. GRU: 3-gate (r/z/n) with reset applied selectively to recurrent contribution. Full 3-tier dispatch. `recurrent.ex` auto-detects and uses fused path; DeepResLSTM, TransformerLike, NTM, and Hybrid also wired.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P4)** — New kernel types for architectures with unique sequential scan patterns. 4 new kernels with full 3-tier dispatch:
  - **Reservoir** — `h = tanh(wx + W_res@h)` with optional leak rate. W_in@x pre-computed on Axon side, W_res@h via shared memory. Returns final state only.
  - **Titans** — Matrix-state `[B,M,M]` surprise-gated momentum update. Pre-concatenated `[Q,K,V,gate]` input, M and momentum in registers.
  - **MIRAS** (Moneta variant) — Generalized Titans with data-dependent alpha/eta gates and L2 row normalization. Yaad/Memora variants fall back to Elixir.
  - **GSA** — Slot memory `[B,H,m,d]` with gated EMA write + softmax read per timestep. Thread per (batch,head,slot), mem in registers.
  - Not needed: Griffin RG-LRU (uses P1 `linear_scan`), HGRN (parallel log-cumsum-exp), InfiniAttention (segment-level, few iterations)
- [ ] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P5) — Backward-Pass Kernels** — Fused backward (gradient) kernels for training-time performance. Each forward scan has a corresponding reverse-time scan that accumulates gradients w.r.t. inputs and initial state. Without fused backward kernels, `Nx.Defn.value_and_grad` falls back to Elixir sequential scan for the backward pass even when the forward pass uses CUDA. Priority targets:
  - **MinGRU / MinLSTM backward** — Reverse scan accumulating dL/dz, dL/dc, dL/dh0
  - **Linear scan backward** — Covers Griffin, MEGA, SSTransformer, HybridBuilder, GSS, MambaVision
  - **DeltaNet / GatedDeltaNet backward** — Matrix-state reverse scan with dL/dQ, dL/dK, dL/dV, dL/dbeta
  - **LSTM / GRU backward** — BPTT with fused gate gradients
  - **Selective scan backward** — Mamba training gradient kernel
- [ ] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P6) — bf16/f16 Kernel Variants** — Half-precision variants of all 19 existing kernels. Doubles memory bandwidth, roughly halves latency for bandwidth-bound kernels. Many ExPhil architectures are close to the 16ms target — bf16 could push them under. Requires: `__half` / `__nv_bfloat16` types, `__hmul`/`__hadd` intrinsics, mixed-precision accumulation (f32 accumulators with bf16 I/O) for numerical stability.
- [ ] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P7) — Matrix-State Linear Attention Family** — Fused kernels for RetNet, RWKV, GLA/GLA v2 recurrences. All are matrix-state scans similar to DeltaNet but with different update rules:
  - **RetNet** — `S_t = gamma * S_{t-1} + k_t @ v_t^T`, fixed exponential decay
  - **RWKV** — WKV mechanism with time-decay, similar structure to RetNet
  - **GLA / GLA v2** — `S_t = G_t * S_{t-1} + k_t @ v_t^T`, per-head learned gating
  - All adaptable from `fused_delta_rule_scan.cu` template with different update math
- [ ] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P8) — Flash Attention Variants** — Modified flash attention kernels for attention architectures with non-standard patterns:
  - **FoX** — Flash attention + per-head learnable forget gate applied post-softmax
  - **MoBA** — Sparse flash attention: MoE router selects KV blocks per query, only compute selected tiles
  - **MTA** — Multi-Token Attention: conv over Q/K dims before attention scoring
  - **LASER** — exp(V) transformation before dot-product attention
  - **InfiniAttention** — Flash attention per chunk + cross-chunk compressive memory accumulation `M_t = M_{t-1} + sigma(K)^T @ V - sigma(K)^T @ (sigma(K) @ M_{t-1})`
- [ ] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P9) — Multi-Layer Fusion** — Keep hidden state in registers across consecutive layers instead of writing to global memory between layers. For a 2-layer MinGRU at seq=32, eliminates 2 global memory round-trips per inference. Could push already-fast architectures below 10ms. Requires fusing the inter-layer projection (dense matmul) into the scan kernel or using shared memory as a staging area.
- [ ] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P10) — Associative Memory Kernels** — Fused kernels for Hopfield and NTM per-step memory operations:
  - **Hopfield** — Iterative energy-based memory retrieval with softmax attention over stored patterns
  - **NTM** — Content + location-based addressing with read/write heads, shift convolution, and sharpening. High register pressure from multiple addressing modes.

## Open — Codebase Quality (from 2026-02-27 evaluation)

Full findings in `notebooks/research/codebase_evaluation.md`.

- [x] **ExCoveralls integration** — `excoveralls` dep added, `coveralls.json` configured (70% minimum), CI calls `mix coveralls.github`, coverage + CI badges in README.

### Documentation — Doctests (Priority: High) ✓

19 doctests across registry, shared blocks, and representative architectures.

- [x] **Doctests for Edifice registry** — `Edifice.build/2`, `list_architectures/0`, `list_families/0`, `module_for/1` (6 doctests in `test/edifice_test.exs`).
- [x] **Doctests for shared blocks** — `TransformerBlock.layer/2`, `FFN.layer/2`, `CrossAttention.layer/3`, `CausalMask.causal/1`, `CausalMask.window/2`, `SinusoidalPE.build_table/1`, `RoPE.precompute_freqs/3`, `SDPA.compute/5` (8 doctests in `test/edifice/blocks/doctest_test.exs`).
- [x] **Doctests for 5 representative architectures** — MLP (with full forward pass), LSTM, Mamba, GAN, ViT (5 doctests in `test/edifice/architecture_doctest_test.exs`).

### Documentation — Guides & Notebooks (Priority: Medium)

- [x] **Composition guide** — `guides/composing_architectures.md`. Covers TransformerBlock callbacks (attention_fn, cross_attention_fn, custom_ffn), ModelBuilder skeletons (sequence + vision), shared blocks table, and 3 composition recipes (custom attention, hybrid encoder-decoder, SSM+attention interleaving).

### CI/CD Improvements (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] **Multi-version test matrix** — Test against Elixir 1.18 + 1.19 + 1.20 on OTP 27 + 28. The `mix.exs` claims `~> 1.18` compatibility; CI should verify it.
- [ ] **Benchmark regression CI** — Run Benchee on 5-10 key architectures in CI. Store baseline timings, fail if >10% regression. Candidate architectures: MLP, LSTM, Mamba, GQA, ViT, DETR (covers major families and input patterns).
- [x] **Normalize git tag format** — All tags now use `v` prefix (`v0.1.1`, `v0.2.0`).

### Pretrained Weight Loading (Priority: Medium)

Load HuggingFace SafeTensors checkpoints into Edifice models. The `safetensors` Elixir package
(v0.1.3, `elixir-nx/safetensors`) handles serialization; the work is key mapping and tensor
transformation between PyTorch and Axon conventions.

**Phase 1 — Core infrastructure (`lib/edifice/pretrained/`):**

- [x] **Add `{:safetensors, "~> 0.1.3"}` dependency** — Add to `mix.exs` as optional dep. Zero runtime cost for users who don't load weights.
- [x] **Key mapping behaviour** — `Edifice.Pretrained.KeyMap` behaviour with `@callback map_key(pytorch_key :: String.t()) :: String.t() | :skip`. Each architecture implements this to translate PyTorch param names (e.g. `model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj.weight`) to Axon layer names. Include `@callback tensor_transforms() :: [{String.t(), (Nx.Tensor.t() -> Nx.Tensor.t())}]` for per-key reshape/transpose rules.
- [x] **Tensor transformation layer** — `Edifice.Pretrained.Transform` module. Handles: (1) Linear weight transpose (`[out, in]` PyTorch -> `[in, out]` Axon), (2) Conv weight permutation (PyTorch OIHW -> Axon format), (3) Dtype casting (fp16/bf16 -> f32 or preserve), (4) Nested key grouping (flat `"layer.0.weight"` -> `%{"layer" => %{"0" => %{"weight" => tensor}}}`).
- [x] **Loader API** — `Edifice.Pretrained.load(module, path_or_url, opts)` that: (1) Reads `.safetensors` file via `Safetensors.read!/2` with lazy loading, (2) Applies module's key mapping, (3) Applies tensor transforms, (4) Returns `Axon.ModelState.t()`. Options: `:backend` (default BinaryBackend), `:dtype` (cast all to given type), `:strict` (error on unmapped keys vs warn).

**Phase 2 — Reference architecture key maps (2-3 models):**

- [x] **ViT key map** — `Edifice.Pretrained.KeyMaps.ViT`. Map from HuggingFace `vit-base-patch16-224` checkpoint. Covers patch embedding, positional embedding, transformer encoder layers, layernorm, classifier head. Includes `concat_keys/0` for QKV concatenation.
- [x] **Whisper key map** — `Edifice.Pretrained.KeyMaps.Whisper`. Map from HuggingFace `whisper-base` checkpoint. Covers: mel encoder conv layers, encoder transformer, decoder transformer, cross-attention projections. Handles 0-based→1-based index shift.
- [x] **ConvNeXt key map** (stretch) — `Edifice.Pretrained.KeyMaps.ConvNeXt`. Map from `facebook/convnext-tiny-224`. Exercises a pure-CNN architecture with depthwise convs, LayerNorm, different param naming patterns from transformers.

**Phase 3 — HuggingFace Hub integration (optional):**

- [x] **Hub download helper** — `Edifice.Pretrained.Hub.download(repo_id, opts)`. Downloads `.safetensors` from HuggingFace Hub via HTTP. Handles: multi-file sharded checkpoints (`model-00001-of-00003.safetensors`), `model.safetensors.index.json` shard index, local caching in `~/.cache/edifice/`, progress reporting via Logger. Optional dep on `req` for HTTP. Also added `Pretrained.load_sharded/3` for multi-file checkpoints.
- [x] **Model card metadata** — Parse `config.json` from HuggingFace repos to auto-detect architecture type and build opts (hidden_size, num_heads, etc.) so users can do `Edifice.Pretrained.from_hub("google/vit-base-patch16-224")` without specifying opts.

**Phase 4 — Validation & docs:**

- [x] **Round-trip tests** — For each reference model: (1) Build Edifice model, (2) Init random weights, (3) `Safetensors.write!` -> `Pretrained.load` round-trip, (4) Assert all params match. Covers ViT (with QKV concat), Whisper (encoder + decoder), and ConvNeXt. 81 pretrained tests total.
- [x] **Numerical validation** — For ViT and Whisper: compare Edifice forward pass output against known PyTorch outputs on reference inputs. Store expected outputs as fixtures. Tolerance: 1e-4 for f32. Fixture generator: `scripts/generate_numerical_fixtures.py`. Tests: `test/edifice/pretrained/numerical_validation_test.exs` (tagged `:external`).
- [x] **Guide** — `guides/loading_pretrained_weights.md`. Walk through: installing dep, downloading checkpoint, loading into model, running inference. Includes troubleshooting for shape mismatches, missing keys, LayerNorm naming, and writing custom key maps.

### Axon.ModelState Deprecation Warnings (Priority: Medium)

- [x] **Fix `passing parameter map to initialization is deprecated, use %Axon.ModelState{}` warnings** — Replaced `init_fn.(template, %{})` with `init_fn.(template, Axon.ModelState.empty())` in 29 test files (113 occurrences). Warnings eliminated.

### ExPhil Inference Benchmarks (Priority: Medium)

- [x] **Profile Griffin vs Mamba gap** — **Root cause: missing `compiler: EXLA`**. Without graph compilation, `pred_fn` re-traces all Axon layer callbacks on every call (~700-2800ms depending on layer count). With `compiler: EXLA`, Griffin 6L runs in **1.9ms** (faster than Mamba 2L at 2.9ms). The gap was 100% Axon re-tracing overhead, not kernel or architecture differences. Fix: add `compiler: EXLA` to exphil's benchmark and inference paths. See `scripts/profile_griffin_mamba.exs`.
- [ ] **Broad fused-kernel benchmark** — Run inference benchmarks across all ~18 exphil architectures that have fused CUDA kernels (MinGRU, MinLSTM, xLSTM, Mamba, GatedSSM, Griffin, DeltaNet, GatedDeltaNet, DeltaProduct, sLSTM, TTT, KDA, RLA, etc.) to get a complete picture of speedups on T400 4GB. Compare with/without fused kernels enabled.

### cuDNN Algorithm Warning (Priority: Low)

- [x] **Investigate `Omitted potentially buggy algorithm eng14{k25=2} for conv` info messages** — Investigated: cuDNN 9.x harmlessly skips algorithm variants during autotuning. Info-level messages from XLA C++ bridged via EXLA.Logger. Already suppressed in tests (`Logger.configure(level: :warning)` in test_helper.exs). Added same suppression to all bench scripts.

### ML-Specific Quality (Priority: Low)
- [ ] **ONNX integration guide** — Document workflow: Edifice.build → Axon model → axon_onnx export → inference in other runtimes. Even if axon_onnx is a separate package, showing the integration path is valuable.
- [x] **Architecture visualization** — `mix edifice.viz mamba` prints layer structure as table (default), ASCII tree (`--format tree`), or Mermaid diagram (`--format mermaid`). Handles tuple-returning models via `--component`. See `Edifice.Display` module.
- [x] **Gradient smoke tests** — 176 passing tests across all 26 families (analytical gradients via `value_and_grad` + parameter sensitivity fallback). Covers sequence models, transformers, vision, detection, audio, robotics, RL, generative, graph, meta/PEFT, contrastive, interpretability, world model, multimodal, scientific, and memory architectures.
