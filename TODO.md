## Open — Infrastructure

- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P0)** — Fused scan kernels for MinGRU, MinLSTM, NativeRecurrence (3 variants), and Liquid (exact solver). Each kernel runs one thread per (batch, hidden) element with state in registers, eliminating per-timestep kernel launch overhead. NIF bridge with GC-tracked cudaMalloc, XLA FFI handlers for EXLA integration. 8 CUDA kernels total. Files: `native/cuda/fused_*.cu`, `c_src/edifice_cuda_nif.c`, `lib/edifice/cuda/{nif,fused_scan}.ex`.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P1)** — Generic `fused_linear_scan` kernel (`h = a*h + b`, no in-kernel nonlinearities) covering 6 architectures: Griffin RG-LRU, MEGA EMA, SSTransformer EMA, HybridBuilder EMA, GSS SSM, MambaVision SSM. All pre-compute `a` and `b` on the XLA side. GSS and MambaVision reshape 3D state `[B,T,D,N]` → `[B,T,D*N]` to reuse the 2D kernel. File: `native/cuda/fused_linear_scan.cu`.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P2)** — Matrix-state recurrences with `[D,D]` state matrices per head. 7 kernels: DeltaNet, GatedDeltaNet, DeltaProduct, sLSTM, TTT, Mamba (selective scan), KDA, RLA (dual-state). All have 3-tier dispatch (custom call → NIF → Elixir). KDA uses per-channel decay; RLA supports both moving-avg and delta-rule variants via mode flag. Files: `native/cuda/fused_{delta_rule,delta_product,slstm,ttt,selective,kda,rla}_scan.cu`.
- [x] **EXLA GPU Custom Call Infrastructure** — GPU-native custom calls staying inside the XLA computation graph (no graph breaks). EXLA fork at `/home/nixos/nx/exla/` with nvcc `.cu` compilation, `-DEXLA_FFI` flag, stablehlo.custom_call bindings in `value.ex`, `cached_recur_operator` CUDA-platform pattern-match in `defn.ex`. Edifice dispatches via `Nx.Shared.optional` with Elixir fallback. All 9 kernels wired: MinGRU, MinLSTM, ELU-GRU, Real-GRU, DiagLinear, Liquid, LinearScan, DeltaNet, GatedDeltaNet. Use `Axon.build(model, compiler: EXLA)` for cached graph compilation (97x speedup).
- [x] **EXLA Custom Calls — All Kernels Wired** — All 9 P0/P1 kernels have `cached_recur_operator` clauses in `defn.ex` and 3-tier dispatch (custom call → NIF → Elixir) in `fused_scan.ex`. 3813 tests pass.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P3)** — Standard LSTM and GRU fused scan kernels. Pre-compute W@x+bias on Axon side, R@h via shared memory in kernel. LSTM: 4-gate (i/f/g/o) with cell+hidden state. GRU: 3-gate (r/z/n) with reset applied selectively to recurrent contribution. Full 3-tier dispatch. `recurrent.ex` auto-detects and uses fused path; DeepResLSTM, TransformerLike, NTM, and Hybrid also wired.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P4)** — New kernel types for architectures with unique sequential scan patterns. 4 new kernels with full 3-tier dispatch:
  - **Reservoir** — `h = tanh(wx + W_res@h)` with optional leak rate. W_in@x pre-computed on Axon side, W_res@h via shared memory. Returns final state only.
  - **Titans** — Matrix-state `[B,M,M]` surprise-gated momentum update. Pre-concatenated `[Q,K,V,gate]` input, M and momentum in registers.
  - **MIRAS** (Moneta variant) — Generalized Titans with data-dependent alpha/eta gates and L2 row normalization. Yaad/Memora variants fall back to Elixir.
  - **GSA** — Slot memory `[B,H,m,d]` with gated EMA write + softmax read per timestep. Thread per (batch,head,slot), mem in registers.
  - Not needed: Griffin RG-LRU (uses P1 `linear_scan`), HGRN (parallel log-cumsum-exp), InfiniAttention (segment-level, few iterations)
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P5) — Backward-Pass Kernels** — Fused backward (gradient) kernels for training-time performance. Each forward scan has a corresponding reverse-time scan that accumulates gradients w.r.t. inputs and initial state. Without fused backward kernels, `Nx.Defn.value_and_grad` falls back to Elixir sequential scan for the backward pass even when the forward pass uses CUDA.
  - [x] **Phase 1 (done)** — Linear scan, MinGRU, MinLSTM backward kernels. Establishes pattern: `custom_grad` wiring, NIF multi-output via concatenated buffer, EXLA FFI multi-Ret. Commit d04210a.
  - [x] **Phase 2 (done)** — 5 P0 element-wise backward kernels: ELU-GRU, Real-GRU, DiagLinear, standard LSTM (BPTT + R@h shared mem), standard GRU (3-gate + R@h shared mem).
  - [x] **Phase 3 (done)** — 5 moderate backward kernels: Liquid (tau/act chain rule), DeltaNet (matrix-state dS reverse), GatedDeltaNet (+ alpha decay grad), DeltaProduct (nested Householder + RMS norm + L2 norm chain), sLSTM (exp gating + 3 accumulators).
  - [x] **Phase 4 — P2 complex backward kernels** — 4 kernels:
    - [x] **Selective scan (Mamba) backward** — Done. State `h[i] = A[i]*h[i] + B[i]*x`, output `y = C@h`. Reverse scan over state dim.
    - [x] **TTT backward** — Inner SGD loop: `W -= eta*(W@k - v)@k^T`. Reverse through SGD steps with dW/deta/dk/dv.
    - [x] **KDA backward** — Channel-wise decay `S = diag(alpha)*S + v@k^T`. Per-channel alpha gradient.
    - [x] **RLA backward** — Dual-state S+R with variant flag. Two reverse accumulators, outputs depend on variant (moving-avg vs delta-rule).
  - **Deferred** — Reservoir (frozen W_res, no training gradient), Titans/MIRAS (niche, complex matrix state), GSA (slot memory).
  - [x] **Phase 5 — Backward Flash Attention + Variants** — 3 backward kernels (flash, LASER, FoX) with full 3-tier dispatch (custom call → NIF → Elixir fallback). Flash: two-phase tiled dK/dV + dQ with precomputed LSE and D. LASER: effective gradient via exp(V - v_max), chain rule dV through log-weighted-sum-exp. FoX: forget bias gradient through online softmax, extra grad_cs output. All have causal mask support, f32 + bf16 variants, and autodiff-validated backward fallbacks.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P6) — bf16 Kernel Variants** — Mixed-precision (bf16 I/O, f32 accumulators) for all 56 fused kernels (36 forward + 20 backward). Shared `precision.cuh` header with `IO_LOAD`/`IO_STORE` macros, compiled twice (`-DUSE_BF16`). Two `.so` libraries produced. NIF dispatch via `dtype` arg (0=f32, 1=bf16). EXLA custom calls use `PRECISION_SUFFIX` for dynamic handler registration. Zero code duplication — same `.cu` source for both precisions.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P7) — Matrix-State Linear Attention Family** — Investigated RetNet, RWKV, GLA/GLA v2. All three already use **parallel** training formulations (decay matrix, log-cumsum-exp, cumulative_sum) with no sequential bottleneck in `build/1`. Fused recurrent kernels would only help single-step inference decoding (not current use case). No new kernels needed.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P8) — Flash Attention Variants** — Modified flash attention kernels for attention architectures with non-standard score/value transformations. 2 new kernels + 1 wiring change:
  - **LASER** — `fused_laser_attention.cu`: accumulates `exp(V - v_max)` instead of V, applies `log(result) + v_max` at output. Precomputes `v_max = reduce_max(V, axes: [seq])` on host. Full 3-tier dispatch.
  - **FoX** — `fused_fox_attention.cu`: adds forget bias `cs[i] - cs[j]` to attention scores before online softmax. Precomputes `cs = cumsum(log(sigmoid(f)))` on host. Always causal. Full 3-tier dispatch.
  - **InfiniAttention** — `local_attention/3` now dispatches through existing `FusedScan.flash_attention` (causal). No new kernel needed — segment-level SDPA is standard attention.
  - **MoBA, MTA** — Deferred: sparse routing (MoBA) and 2D conv on logit matrix (MTA) don't fit tiled flash attention pattern.
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P9) — Multi-Layer Block Scan Fusion** — Keep hidden state in registers across consecutive layers, fusing LayerNorm + GEMV + scan + residual into one kernel per timestep. Extends existing MinGRU/MinLSTM block pattern to additional architectures with scalar/small state.
  - [x] **Phase 1 — Linear Scan Block Kernel** — `fused_linear_block_scan.cu`: h=a*h+b with inter-layer LayerNorm+GEMV. Covers Griffin RG-LRU, MEGA EMA, SSTransformer, HybridBuilder, GSS, MambaVision. Weight layout: `[W_a(H×H)|b_a(H)|W_b(H×H)|b_b(H)|γ(H)|β(H)]` per layer. Full 3-tier dispatch.
  - [x] **Phase 2 — LSTM Block Kernel** — `fused_lstm_block_scan.cu`: 4-gate LSTM with h+c state in registers, R@h via shared memory. Covers DeepResLSTM. Weight layout: `[W_x(H×4H)|b_x(4H)|R(H×4H)|γ(H)|β(H)]`. Full 3-tier dispatch.
  - [x] **Phase 3 — GRU Block Kernel** — `fused_gru_block_scan.cu`: 3-gate GRU with R@h via shared memory. Weight layout: `[W_x(H×3H)|b_x(3H)|R(H×3H)|γ(H)|β(H)]`. Full 3-tier dispatch.
  - [x] **Phase 4 — Benchmarks & Architecture Wiring** — `bench/block_scan_sweep.exs` benchmark. DeepResLSTM wired with `pack_block_weights/3` + `fused_block_inference/5`. Griffin RG-LRU not feasible for generic `linear_block` (non-linear gate interactions: `a^(c*r_t)`, `sqrt(1-a_t^2)` scaling).
- [x] **CUDA Kernel Fusion (P10) — Associative Memory Kernels** — Investigated Hopfield and NTM. No new kernels needed:
  - **Hopfield** — Single-pass attention (`softmax(beta * X @ Y^T) @ Y`), not a recurrence. Already optimal under cuBLAS/flash attention.
  - **NTM** — Single-step model (one timestep per forward pass). Addressing pipeline (content → interpolation → shift → sharpen) is a chain of small ops, not a sequential scan. LSTM controller already uses fused LSTM kernel via `build_raw_rnn`.

- [x] **Doctests for 5 representative architectures** — MLP (with full forward pass), LSTM, Mamba, GAN, ViT (5 doctests in `test/edifice/architecture_doctest_test.exs`).

### Documentation — Guides & Notebooks (Priority: Medium)

- [x] **Composition guide** — `guides/composing_architectures.md`. Covers TransformerBlock callbacks (attention_fn, cross_attention_fn, custom_ffn), ModelBuilder skeletons (sequence + vision), shared blocks table, and 3 composition recipes (custom attention, hybrid encoder-decoder, SSM+attention interleaving).
- [x] **Livebook notebooks** — 13 notebooks: training_mlp, architecture_zoo, architecture_comparison, lm_architecture_shootout, sequence_modeling, graph_classification, generative_models, small_language_model, liquid_neural_networks, softmax_shootout, agent_swarm_patterns, composing_from_blocks, whisper_asr_demo.
- [ ] **Verify new notebooks** — Run each of the 3 newest notebooks (composing_from_blocks, whisper_asr_demo, agent_swarm_patterns) end-to-end in Livebook. Check: cells execute without errors, visualizations render, prose is accurate, setup cells work in both standalone and attached modes.
- [x] **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** — Contributor Covenant v2.1, downloaded from contributor-covenant.org.

### Module Decomposition (Priority: Low-Medium)

- [x] **Split multi_head.ex** — Extracted pure tensor attention computations into `Edifice.Attention.Primitives` (~580 lines). Slimmed `multi_head.ex` to ~634 lines (Axon layer/model builders only). Deduplicated `causal_mask`/`window_mask` via `defdelegate` to `Edifice.Blocks.CausalMask`. All public APIs preserved via delegation.
- [x] **Vision backbone interface** — `Edifice.Vision.Backbone` behaviour with `build_backbone/1`, `feature_size/1`, and `input_shape/1` callbacks. Adopted by 12 modules: ViT, DeiT, Swin, ConvNeXt, MLPMixer, PoolFormer, FocalNet, MetaFormer, EfficientViT, MambaVision, DINOv2, DINOv3. Dispatch helper `Backbone.build_backbone(Module, opts)`.

### CI/CD Improvements (Priority: Medium)

- [x] **Benchmark regression CI** — Run Benchee on 7 key architectures (MLP, LSTM, Mamba, GQA, MinGRU, ViT, DETR) in CI. Baseline in `bench/results/ci_baseline.json`, 20% threshold for shared runner variance. `bench/regression_ci.exs` + CI job parallel to test pipeline.
- [x] **Normalize git tag format** — All tags now use `v` prefix (`v0.1.1`, `v0.2.0`).

### Pretrained Weight Loading (Priority: Medium)

Load HuggingFace SafeTensors checkpoints into Edifice models. The `safetensors` Elixir package
(v0.1.3, `elixir-nx/safetensors`) handles serialization; the work is key mapping and tensor
transformation between PyTorch and Axon conventions.

**Phase 1 — Core infrastructure (`lib/edifice/pretrained/`):**

- [x] **Add `{:safetensors, "~> 0.1.3"}` dependency** — Add to `mix.exs` as optional dep. Zero runtime cost for users who don't load weights.
- [x] **Key mapping behaviour** — `Edifice.Pretrained.KeyMap` behaviour with `@callback map_key(pytorch_key :: String.t()) :: String.t() | :skip`. Each architecture implements this to translate PyTorch param names (e.g. `model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj.weight`) to Axon layer names. Include `@callback tensor_transforms() :: [{String.t(), (Nx.Tensor.t() -> Nx.Tensor.t())}]` for per-key reshape/transpose rules.
- [x] **Tensor transformation layer** — `Edifice.Pretrained.Transform` module. Handles: (1) Linear weight transpose (`[out, in]` PyTorch -> `[in, out]` Axon), (2) Conv weight permutation (PyTorch OIHW -> Axon format), (3) Dtype casting (fp16/bf16 -> f32 or preserve), (4) Nested key grouping (flat `"layer.0.weight"` -> `%{"layer" => %{"0" => %{"weight" => tensor}}}`).
- [x] **Loader API** — `Edifice.Pretrained.load(module, path_or_url, opts)` that: (1) Reads `.safetensors` file via `Safetensors.read!/2` with lazy loading, (2) Applies module's key mapping, (3) Applies tensor transforms, (4) Returns `Axon.ModelState.t()`. Options: `:backend` (default BinaryBackend), `:dtype` (cast all to given type), `:strict` (error on unmapped keys vs warn).

**Phase 2 — Reference architecture key maps (2-3 models):**

- [x] **ViT key map** — `Edifice.Pretrained.KeyMaps.ViT`. Map from HuggingFace `vit-base-patch16-224` checkpoint. Covers patch embedding, positional embedding, transformer encoder layers, layernorm, classifier head. Includes `concat_keys/0` for QKV concatenation.
- [x] **Whisper key map** — `Edifice.Pretrained.KeyMaps.Whisper`. Map from HuggingFace `whisper-base` checkpoint. Covers: mel encoder conv layers, encoder transformer, decoder transformer, cross-attention projections. Handles 0-based→1-based index shift.
- [x] **ConvNeXt key map** (stretch) — `Edifice.Pretrained.KeyMaps.ConvNeXt`. Map from `facebook/convnext-tiny-224`. Exercises a pure-CNN architecture with depthwise convs, LayerNorm, different param naming patterns from transformers.

**Phase 3 — HuggingFace Hub integration (optional):**

- [x] **Hub download helper** — `Edifice.Pretrained.Hub.download(repo_id, opts)`. Downloads `.safetensors` from HuggingFace Hub via HTTP. Handles: multi-file sharded checkpoints (`model-00001-of-00003.safetensors`), `model.safetensors.index.json` shard index, local caching in `~/.cache/edifice/`, progress reporting via Logger. Optional dep on `req` for HTTP. Also added `Pretrained.load_sharded/3` for multi-file checkpoints.
- [x] **Model card metadata** — Parse `config.json` from HuggingFace repos to auto-detect architecture type and build opts (hidden_size, num_heads, etc.) so users can do `Edifice.Pretrained.from_hub("google/vit-base-patch16-224")` without specifying opts.

**Phase 4 — Validation & docs:**

- [x] **Round-trip tests** — For each reference model: (1) Build Edifice model, (2) Init random weights, (3) `Safetensors.write!` -> `Pretrained.load` round-trip, (4) Assert all params match. Covers ViT (with QKV concat), Whisper (encoder + decoder), and ConvNeXt. 81 pretrained tests total.
- [x] **Numerical validation** — For ViT and Whisper: compare Edifice forward pass output against known PyTorch outputs on reference inputs. Store expected outputs as fixtures. Tolerance: 1e-4 for f32. Fixture generator: `scripts/generate_numerical_fixtures.py`. Tests: `test/edifice/pretrained/numerical_validation_test.exs` (tagged `:external`).
- [x] **Guide** — `guides/loading_pretrained_weights.md`. Walk through: installing dep, downloading checkpoint, loading into model, running inference. Includes troubleshooting for shape mismatches, missing keys, LayerNorm naming, and writing custom key maps.

### Axon.ModelState Deprecation Warnings (Priority: Medium)

- [x] **Fix `passing parameter map to initialization is deprecated, use %Axon.ModelState{}` warnings** — Replaced `init_fn.(template, %{})` with `init_fn.(template, Axon.ModelState.empty())` in 29 test files (113 occurrences). Warnings eliminated.

### ExPhil Inference Benchmarks (Priority: Medium)

- [x] **Profile Griffin vs Mamba gap** — **Root cause: missing `compiler: EXLA`**. Without graph compilation, `pred_fn` re-traces all Axon layer callbacks on every call (~700-2800ms depending on layer count). With `compiler: EXLA`, Griffin 6L runs in **1.9ms** (faster than Mamba 2L at 2.9ms). The gap was 100% Axon re-tracing overhead, not kernel or architecture differences. Fix: add `compiler: EXLA` to exphil's benchmark and inference paths. See `scripts/profile_griffin_mamba.exs`.
- [x] **Broad fused-kernel benchmark** — `bench/fused_kernel_sweep.exs`. Phase 1: raw kernel latency (eager dispatch). Phase 2: full model inference via `Axon.build(compiler: EXLA)`. 15/21 architectures complete a forward pass, all under 16ms (60 FPS). Top: min_gru/liquid/min_lstm at 1.36ms (~735 FPS). delta_product/slstm eager speedups: 100-110x vs Elixir fallback.
- [x] **Training benchmark (Phase 3)** — `bench/fused_kernel_sweep.exs` Phase 3: `value_and_grad` training throughput. 15/21 archs complete. Top: liquid 1.53ms (654 FPS), min_gru 1.56ms (639 FPS). Matrix-state models slower: slstm 26ms, gsa 19ms, ttt 18ms.

### Mamba Training Performance Bug (Priority: High)

- [x] **Mamba fwd+bwd pathologically slow at small hidden dims** — **Root cause:** `h_prev_store[1024][32]` = 128KB per-thread local memory in `fused_selective_scan_backward.cu`. At batch=64, hidden=128: 8192 threads × 128KB = 1GB DRAM-backed local memory thrashing 72MB L2 cache → 764ms. **Fix:** Reduced `MAX_SEQ_LEN` from 1024 to 128 (16KB/thread). Result: 764ms → 7.5ms (100x speedup), ratio now 4.8x matching other architectures. Sequences >128 fall back to Elixir.

### Fused Kernel Benchmark — Failures to Fix (Priority: Medium)

**Caught errors (non-crashing):**
- [x] **RLA custom call missing attributes** — Fixed: XLA has a 7-operand limit for `stablehlo.custom_call` (segfaults with 8+). Hardcoded variant=0 and clip_threshold=1.0 in C++ FFI handler, stripping them from operands. Forward: 6 operands, backward: 7 operands (forward_out+grad_output packed into `[2,B,T,H,d]`). Also fixed gate shape mismatch (`[B,T,H,1,1]` → `[B,T,H]` reshape in defn.ex).
- [x] **Reservoir EXLA compilation failure** — Fixed: `Axon.constant` passes concrete tensors into callbacks, which `Nx.Shared.optional` can't trace. Changed to `Axon.nx` with closure-captured frozen weights, calling `reservoir_scan_fallback` directly (EXLA compiles Nx ops to efficient XLA graph). EXLA vs CPU diff: 3.6e-7.
- [x] **RLA training gradient shape mismatch** — Fixed: backward fallback gate tensors `[B,H,1,1]` couldn't broadcast with `[B,H,d]` vectors. Added reshape to `[B,H,1]` before vector gradient computations.

**Segfaults (all fixed — root cause: scalar buffer operands in XLA custom calls):**
- [x] **Titans segfault** — Fixed: Scalar `ffi::Buffer<ffi::F32>` momentum operand caused XLA MLIR compilation segfault. Momentum now packed into combined tensor as extra column `[B,T,4*M+1]`, read via `cudaMemcpy` in FFI handler.
- [x] **MIRAS segfault** — Fixed: Same scalar momentum operand issue as Titans. Momentum packed into combined tensor `[B,T,5*M+1]`.
- [x] **LASER attention segfault** — Fixed: Scalar `ffi::AnyBuffer` causal flag caused segfault. Hardcoded causal=1 in both forward and backward FFI handlers.
- [x] **Flash attention segfault** — Fixed: Same scalar causal flag issue. Hardcoded causal=1 in both forward and backward FFI handlers.
- [x] **InfiniAttention segfault** — Fixed: Uses flash attention internally, fixed by flash attention fix above.
- [x] **Reservoir custom call** — Fixed: Scalar `ffi::Buffer<ffi::F32>` leak_rate operand. Leak_rate now packed into h0 tensor as extra column `[B, H+1]`, read via `cudaMemcpy` in FFI handler.

See `docs/cuda_custom_call_debugging.md` for the full debugging methodology and known XLA FFI pitfalls.

### cuDNN Algorithm Warning (Priority: Low)

- [x] **Investigate `Omitted potentially buggy algorithm eng14{k25=2} for conv` info messages** — Investigated: cuDNN 9.x harmlessly skips algorithm variants during autotuning. Info-level messages from XLA C++ bridged via EXLA.Logger. Already suppressed in tests (`Logger.configure(level: :warning)` in test_helper.exs). Added same suppression to all bench scripts.

### Internal Cleanup (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] **FNet: replace DFT workaround with native Nx.fft** — FNet and FNO use real-valued DFT matrix multiply instead of Nx.fft because EXLA autodiff used to break. The underlying bug was fixed in elixir-nx/nx#1410 (Dec 2023). Confirmed working on EXLA with test/fft-exla-autodiff branch. Files: `lib/edifice/attention/fnet.ex` (fourier_mixing_real, dft_real_matrix), `lib/edifice/scientific/fno.ex` (fft_1d, ifft_1d, complex_matmul).

### Internal Utils (Priority: Low)
- [ ] **Mixed precision helper** — Add `Edifice.Utils.Common.with_f32_precision(inputs, fun)` that wraps the save-type/upcast/compute/cast-back boilerplate used ~15 times across fused_ops.ex and other modules. Nx maintainers decided this doesn't belong in Nx core (see elixir-nx/nx#1701).

### ML-Specific Quality (Priority: Low)
- [x] **ONNX integration guide** — `guides/onnx_integration.md`. Covers axon_onnx export/import, ortex (ONNX Runtime bindings), when to use which, Edifice-specific limitations (custom kernels export via fallback), and troubleshooting.
- [x] **Architecture visualization** — `mix edifice.viz mamba` prints layer structure as table (default), ASCII tree (`--format tree`), or Mermaid diagram (`--format mermaid`). Handles tuple-returning models via `--component`. See `Edifice.Display` module.
- [x] **Gradient smoke tests** — 176 passing tests across all 26 families (analytical gradients via `value_and_grad` + parameter sensitivity fallback). Covers sequence models, transformers, vision, detection, audio, robotics, RL, generative, graph, meta/PEFT, contrastive, interpretability, world model, multimodal, scientific, and memory architectures.

## Open — Next Phase (from `notebooks/research/future_directions.md`)

### Phase 1 — Trust & Usability (Priority: High)

#### Numerical Correctness Suite
Expand PyTorch reference validation beyond ViT/Whisper to 10 key architectures. Pre-generate fixtures via `scripts/generate_numerical_fixtures.py` (pretrained) and `scripts/generate_random_weight_fixtures.py` (random-weight), compare forward pass at `atol=1e-4`. Gradient validation for architectures with CUDA backward kernels. Random-weight tests in `test/edifice/pretrained/architecture_numerical_test.exs`, shared helper in `test/support/numerical_fixture_helper.ex`. See Direction 4 in `notebooks/research/future_directions.md`.

- [x] **LSTM numerical validation** — Random-weight fixture + cross-framework forward pass comparison (`architecture_numerical_test.exs`)
- [x] **Mamba numerical validation** — Random-weight fixture + cross-framework forward pass comparison (`architecture_numerical_test.exs`)
- [x] **GQA numerical validation** — Random-weight fixture + cross-framework forward pass comparison (`architecture_numerical_test.exs`)
- [x] **MinGRU numerical validation** — Random-weight fixture + cross-framework forward pass comparison (`architecture_numerical_test.exs`)
- [x] **DeltaNet numerical validation** — Random-weight fixture + forward + backward gradient comparison (`architecture_numerical_test.exs`)

- [x] **ResNet numerical validation** — Key map (`key_maps/resnet.ex`), config registry entry, PyTorch fixture generator, forward pass test
  - [x] **Fix pretrained config test** — `supported_model_types/0` test expects `["convnext", "vit", "whisper"]` but now returns `["convnext", "resnet", "vit", "whisper"]` after adding the ResNet key map. Update assertion in `test/edifice/pretrained/config_test.exs:9`.
- [x] **GAT numerical validation** — Random-weight fixture + cross-framework forward pass comparison (`architecture_numerical_test.exs`)
- [x] **ConvNeXt numerical validation** — PyTorch fixture generator + forward pass test (key map already existed)
- [x] **Generate pretrained fixtures** — `python scripts/generate_numerical_fixtures.py` produces 5 fixtures: ViT, Whisper (3000 mel frames), ConvNeXt, ResNet, DETR.
- [ ] **Run pretrained validation with EXLA** — Structural fixes applied (`.data` map for ViT/Whisper, `build_with_pretrained` init+merge for ResNet/DETR, correct input keys). Too slow for BinaryBackend. Run: `EXLA=1 mix test --include external`. May need tolerance tuning. See `docs/plans/pretrained-validation-fixes.md`.
- [x] **Generate random-weight fixtures** — 7 SafeTensors files generated, all 8 tests passing.
- [x] **Verify random-weight key mappings at runtime** — All fixed: LSTM per-gate params, GQA FFN names, Mamba conv transpose, DiT gate sigmoid.
- [x] **Tune tolerances** — All pass at `atol=1e-4` (GQA at `5e-4`).

#### Applied Task Benchmarks
`bench/tasks/` suite evaluating architectures on small standardized tasks. Answers "which architecture for my problem?" See Direction 1 in `notebooks/research/future_directions.md`.

- [ ] **Copy/recall task** — Synthetic. Compare LSTM, Mamba, Titans, SSM variants. Metric: accuracy vs sequence length.

### Phase 2 — Production Path (Priority: Medium)

#### Inference Serving Layer
`Edifice.Serving` — from "I loaded weights" to "I'm serving predictions." See Direction 2 in `notebooks/research/future_directions.md`.

- [x] **Batched inference server** — `Edifice.Serving.InferenceServer` GenServer with request batching, timeout dispatch, metrics.
- [x] **Autoregressive generation loop** — `Edifice.Serving.Generate` with KV cache management, temperature/top-k/top-p sampling, Gumbel-max.
- [x] **Speculative decoding integration** — `Edifice.Serving.Speculative` + `Edifice.Serving.MedusaGenerate` wired into generation loop.
- [x] **Streaming output** — `Generate.generate_stream/3` (callback) + `Generate.token_stream/3` (lazy Stream).

#### Training Recipes
`Edifice.Recipes` — pre-built training configurations with sensible defaults. See Direction 6 in `notebooks/research/future_directions.md`.

- [x] **Classification recipe** — `Edifice.Recipes.classify/2`. Cross-entropy, AdamW, cosine LR, early stopping, accuracy metric, label smoothing, mixed precision.

- [x] **Recipe introspection** — `Edifice.Recipes.describe/2`. Returns config summary map for any recipe.
- [ ] **Remat integration in recipes** — Add `:remat` option to all recipes. When `remat: true`, wrap the model's predict_fn with `Edifice.Training.remat/2` inside the Axon.Loop train step. Requires custom step_fn in `Axon.Loop.trainer`.
- [ ] **LoRA adapter injection** — Wire `Edifice.Meta.LoRA.inject/3` into `fine_tune/3` when `strategy: :lora`. Currently `:lora` strategy only unfreezes lora-named params but doesn't inject adapters. Should accept `:rank` and `:alpha` options.
- [x] **Validation loop attachment** — Add `:validation_data` option to recipes. When provided, attach `Axon.Loop.validate` to log validation metrics each epoch. Add validation loss to early stopping criteria.
- [x] **Checkpoint saving** — Add `:checkpoint_path` option. When set, attach `Axon.Loop.checkpoint` to save `ModelState` at each epoch (or best-so-far by validation loss).
- [x] **Regression recipe** — `Edifice.Recipes.regress/2`. MSE/Huber loss, AdamW, cosine LR. Metrics: MSE, MAE. For continuous output tasks.
- [ ] **End-to-end recipe Livebook** — `notebooks/training_recipes.livemd`. Demonstrates classify + fine_tune + contrastive on small synthetic data with Edifice models. Shows `describe/2`, training, evaluation.

#### Non-Kernel Performance Optimizations
Beyond fused CUDA kernels — compiler, runtime, and serving optimizations for faster inference and training.

- [x] **XLA compiler flags sweep** — `bench/xla_flags_sweep.exs`. Benchmarks representative architectures under current XLA_FLAGS. Documents recommended flag combinations for latency vs throughput.
- [x] **Graph-level profiling** — `Edifice.Profile` module. Compilation + inference profiling with EXLA telemetry hooks, memory stats, multi-architecture comparison tables.
- [x] **Autoregressive generation loop** — `Edifice.Serving.Generate` (build_lm/1, generate/3, generate_simple/3) + `Edifice.Serving.Sampling` (temperature, top-k, top-p, Gumbel-max). `bench/generation_bench.exs` for position-aware vs recompute benchmarking.
- [ ] **Run XLA flags sweep on GPU** — Execute `bench/xla_flags_sweep.exs` with EXLA on RTX 5090. Test flag combos: `--xla_gpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler`, `--xla_gpu_graph_level={1,2,3}`, `--xla_gpu_enable_command_buffer`. Document winning combo in `guides/xla_optimization.md`.
- [ ] **Run generation benchmark on GPU** — Execute `bench/generation_bench.exs` with EXLA compiler. Measure position-aware vs recompute speedup. Test with decoder_only architecture at realistic dims (256 embed, 4 layers, 8 heads).

- [x] **Batched inference server** — `Edifice.Serving.InferenceServer` GenServer with request batching, timeout dispatch, metrics.
- [x] **Persistent compilation cache** — `Edifice.Compiler` module wrapping `Axon.build/2` with EXLA disk cache (`cache: path` option). XLA autotune cache via `--xla_gpu_per_fusion_autotune_cache_dir` in devenv.nix. Benchmark: `bench/compilation_cache_bench.exs`.
- [x] **Nx-level mixed precision auto-casting** — `Edifice.MixedPrecision` module. Presets (`:bf16`, `:fp16`) auto-cast all layers except normalization (layer_norm, batch_norm, rms_norm, adaptive_norm, group_norm) via `Axon.MixedPrecision`. Dynamic gradient loss scaling (`init_loss_scale/1`, `scale_loss/2`, `unscale_grads/2`) with growth/backoff. Model summary for precision audit. Benchmark: `bench/mixed_precision_bench.exs`.
- [ ] **Run mixed precision benchmark on GPU** — Execute `bench/mixed_precision_bench.exs` with EXLA on RTX 5090. Measure actual bf16 speedup (expect ~1.5-2x on Ampere+). Compare with CUDA kernel bf16 variants.
- [ ] **Mixed precision training integration** — Wire `MixedPrecision.with_loss_scaling/2` into an Axon.Loop training example. End-to-end bf16 training with loss scaling on a small decoder_only LM. Validate gradients don't diverge.
- [x] **Gradient checkpointing / remat** — `Edifice.Training` module. `remat/2` wraps predict_fn for forward-pass reuse. `checkpointed_grad/4` separates forward/backward for true activation recomputation. `estimate_memory/3` + `format_memory/1` for memory savings estimation. `checkpoint/1` for segment-level control. 14 tests including decoder_only integration.
- [ ] **Remat GPU memory validation** — Run `checkpointed_grad` vs normal `value_and_grad` on a large decoder_only model (4+ layers, 256+ embed) with EXLA on GPU. Measure actual peak memory reduction via `EXLA.Client.get_memory_statistics`. Target: `bench/remat_memory_bench.exs`.
- [ ] **Segment-level checkpointing** — Extend `Edifice.Training` with `remat_segments/2` that splits an Axon model into N segments, checkpointing each independently. Achieves O(sqrt(N)) memory with ~1.5x compute (vs 2x for full checkpoint). Requires Axon graph partitioning.
- [ ] **Training loop integration** — `Edifice.Training.train_step/4` combining `checkpointed_grad` + `MixedPrecision` + optimizer update in one function. Wire into `Axon.Loop` as a custom train_step.
#### Using the Serving Layer
Exercises for the new `Edifice.Serving.*` modules. Validates real-world usage and finds rough edges.

- [ ] **End-to-end generation demo** — Livebook or script that builds a decoder_only LM, loads/initializes params, and generates text with `Generate.generate/3`. Show streaming output with `generate_stream/3`. Target: working demo in `notebooks/small_language_model.livemd`.
- [ ] **Speculative decoding benchmark** — Compare `Speculative.generate` (draft=min_gru, verifier=decoder_only) vs vanilla `Generate.generate` on same model. Measure tokens/sec, acceptance rate via `:on_accept` callback. Target: `bench/speculative_bench.exs`.
- [ ] **Medusa benchmark** — Compare `MedusaGenerate.generate` vs vanilla on decoder_only + 4 Medusa heads. Measure tokens/sec, accepted tokens per round. Target: `bench/medusa_bench.exs`.
- [ ] **InferenceServer load test** — Spawn N concurrent clients calling `InferenceServer.predict/2`. Measure throughput at batch_size={1,4,8,16}, concurrency={1,4,8}. Target: `bench/inference_server_bench.exs`.

- [ ] **KV cache attention integration** — Wire `KVCache.build_cached_attention/1` into decoder_only's GQA layer for true O(n) per-step decoding. Benchmark vs current pad-and-recompute approach.

### Phase 3 — Discovery & Polish (Priority: Low-Medium)

#### Interactive Model Explorer
Livebook Smart Cell for browsing, configuring, and comparing Edifice architectures interactively. Uses `Kino.SmartCell` behaviour with inline JS/CSS assets.

**Smart Cell Core** (`lib/edifice/smart_cell/model_explorer.ex`):
- [x] **Model Cell module** — `use Kino.SmartCell, name: "Edifice Model Explorer"`. Callbacks: `init/2` (defaults from registry), `handle_connect/1` (push family/arch lists), `handle_event/3` (family select, arch select, opt changes), `to_attrs/1`, `to_source/1` (generates `Edifice.build(arch, opts)` code). Persists attrs for notebook reload. Compile-time guarded with `if Code.ensure_loaded?(Kino.SmartCell)`.
- [x] **Architecture registry integration** — Populates family/architecture dropdowns from `Edifice.list_families/0` at init. `scan_eval_result/2` captures built Axon models for summary display.
- [x] **Option builder UI** — JavaScript form dynamically renders common + family-specific options (embed_dim, num_heads, num_layers, state_size, etc.). 3-column grid, number inputs with change events.
- [x] **Model summary panel** — After evaluation, `scan_eval_result/2` computes layer count (via `Axon.reduce_nodes`), param count and memory (via `Edifice.Display.as_table`), broadcasts to JS.
- [x] **JS/CSS assets** — Inline `asset "main.js"` + `asset "main.css"`. Vanilla JS, no npm deps. Livebook-compatible CSS custom properties.
- [x] **Demo Livebook** — `notebooks/model_explorer_demo.livemd`. Setup, Smart Cell usage, manual equivalent, model inspection, architecture comparison, recipe wiring.

**Manual Testing** (Livebook):
- [ ] **Smoke-test Smart Cell in Livebook** — Open `notebooks/model_explorer_demo.livemd`, register cell, insert "Edifice Model Explorer". Verify: family dropdown populates (26 families), architecture dropdown filters by family, option inputs render and update, generated code evaluates to valid `%Axon{}`, summary bar shows layers/params/memory after eval.
- [ ] **Test persistence** — Save notebook with a configured Smart Cell, close and reopen. Verify family, architecture, options, and variable name all restore correctly.
- [ ] **Test tuple architectures** — Select generative → vae, evaluate. Verify generated code uses `{encoder, decoder} = Edifice.build(:vae, ...)` destructuring and the cell evaluates without error.
- [ ] **Test all families** — Click through each of the 26 families, verify architecture dropdown updates and at least one architecture per family builds successfully.

**Comparison & Exploration** (future):
- [ ] **Side-by-side comparison cell** — Second Smart Cell (`"Edifice Compare"`) that takes 2-4 architecture selections, builds each, and displays a comparison table: param count, layer depth, estimated memory (`Training.estimate_memory`), forward pass latency (optional, with EXLA).
- [ ] **Recipe integration** — Dropdown to select a training recipe (`classify`, `language_model`, etc.) and auto-generate `Edifice.Recipes.describe/2` output alongside the model config. Shows recommended hyperparameters for the selected arch+recipe combo.

#### Architecture Recommender / AutoML
- [ ] **Edifice.AutoML.recommend/2** — Given task type + constraints (latency, params, GPU/CPU), suggest top-3 architectures with hyperparameters. Rule-based + benchmark data from task suite.
- [ ] **Hyperparameter search** — Wrap Axon.Loop with Bayesian optimization over architecture opts (hidden_size, num_layers, num_heads). Small search space, few epochs.
- [ ] **Architecture morphisms** — Given a trained small model, grow into larger architecture (Net2Net-style). Leverage pretrained weight loading infrastructure.

#### Applied Task Benchmarks
`bench/tasks/` suite — train small models on real tasks to answer "which architecture for my problem?"

All 6 bench files written and verified. `value_and_grad` + EXLA fix applied (`Nx.backend_copy` to BinaryBackend). See `docs/bench_tasks_fixup_plan.md` for results.

- [x] **Fix `value_and_grad` EXLA/Expr incompatibility** — Applied `Nx.backend_copy` on captured tensors (inputs, targets, model state) in `TaskHelpers.train/4`.
- [x] **Sequence classification** — Cumsum sign prediction. 4/5 pass, min_gru 60.9%. `bench/tasks/sequence_classification.exs`.
- [x] **Image classification** — Quadrant brightness. 4/5 pass, mlp_mixer 34.4%. `bench/tasks/image_classification.exs`.
- [x] **Graph classification** — Edge density. 4/4 pass, gin_v2 50.0%. `bench/tasks/graph_classification.exs`.
- [x] **Autoregressive generation** — Repeating grammar. 4/4 pass, 3 models 100%. `bench/tasks/autoregressive.exs`.
- [x] **Copy/recall task** — Template memory. 4/6 pass, ~26.6%. `bench/tasks/copy_recall.exs`.
- [x] **Verify all tasks** — All 5 benches run, at least 1 arch per task above random baseline.
- [ ] **Known arch failures** — LSTM (Axon rnn_state bug), ResNet (conv + value_and_grad), Titans (arithmetic error). Not fixable in bench code.
- [ ] **Tune underperforming tasks** — copy/recall barely learns, image classification mostly random. May need more epochs or better data generation.
